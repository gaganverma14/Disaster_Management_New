        <div class="col-lg-6 mx-auto">
          <p class="lead mb-4">Disasters take many shapes. Human-made disasters result from human errors and include industrial explosions or structure failures. Natural disasters result from physical phenomena and include earthquakes and droughts. Disasters classified as complex can include epidemics or armed conflicts.
            In whatever form, disasters disrupt communities and can take a serious toll on people, property, economies, and the environment. They often stretch a communityâ€™s capacity to cope. 
            Disaster management is a process of effectively preparing for and responding to disasters. It involves strategically organizing resources to lessen the harm that disasters cause. It also involves a systematic approach to managing the responsibilities of disaster prevention, preparedness, response, and recovery.

                  <p class="card-text"><h3>Prevention</h3><br>Mitigation and prevention efforts aim to reduce the potential damage and suffering that disasters can cause. While disaster management cannot prevent disasters, it can prevent them from becoming compounded as a result of neglecting causal factors and manageable risks. Mitigation specifically refers to actions taken that can lessen the severity of a disasterâ€™s impact. Investing in measures that limit hazards can greatly reduce the burden of disasters.

                    <br><br>Strategies that disaster management professionals implement to protect vulnerable communities and limit hazards include the following:<br><br>
                    
                    <li>Raising awareness about potential hazards and how to address them</li> 
                    <li>Educating the public about how to properly prepare for different types of disaster</li> 
                    <li>Installing and strengthening prediction and warning systems</li> 
                    
                    <br>Managing hazards and risks means planning to minimize a communityâ€™s vulnerability to disasters. This can involve:<br><br>
                    
                    <li>Encouraging community members to buy appropriate insurance to protect their properties and belongings</li> 
                    <li>Educating families and businesses on how to create effective disaster plans</li> 
                    <li>Promoting the use of fire-retardant materials in construction</li> 
                    <li>Advocating for capital works initiatives, such as the construction and maintenance of levees</li> 
                    <li>Building partnerships between sectors and agencies at the federal, state, and local levels to collaborate on mitigation projects</li>
                  
                    <br>Additionally, mitigation efforts can do the following:<br><br>

                    <li>Address ways to engineer bridges to sustain earthquakes</li>
                    <li>Enforce building codes that safeguard buildings during hurricanes</li>

                    <br><br>Disaster preparedness plans:<br><br>
                    
                    <li>Identify organizational resources</li>
                    <li>Designate roles and responsibilities</li>
                    <li>Create procedures and policies</li>
                    <li>Organize activities that improve disaster readiness</li>

                    <br>Anticipating the needs of communities that disasters affect improves the quality of the response efforts. Building the capacities of volunteers, personnel, and disaster management teams to respond to disasters also makes the response efforts more effective.
                    
                    <br>Plans may include the following:<br><br>

                    <li>Evacuation routes</li>

                    <li>Stockpile needs</li>

Following an initial response, efforts shift toward supporting communities as they rebuild emotionally, economically, and physically.

                    <br>Disaster relief addresses the immediate and short-term needs of disaster-affected communities. It can include evacuations, search and rescue missions, and emergency medical assistance.
